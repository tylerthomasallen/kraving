# JavaScript Assessment - practice
**Windows Users**: Please use one of our workstation machines for the assessments.

This assessment aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic
and intermediate features. You will not be tested on HTML Canvas,
jQuery, or AJAX.

You have **80 minutes**. The specs live in the `spec/` directory. Your code
should go in the `src/` directory in the files provided. To submit, rename the
directory `${first_name}_${last_name}`, zip it, then upload to progress tracker.

How to run the specs: open up `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.  

Tips for debugging with Jasmine in the browser:
  * In the upper left corner, click on `Spec List` or `Failures` to toggle
    between spec stack traces and a list of passing specs, respectively.  
  * From the `Spec List` view, click the function name or individual spec
    description to run only that test(s)
